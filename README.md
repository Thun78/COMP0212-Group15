## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **COMP0212 - Modelling and Simulation** (Group 15 - Ted Tang, Muxin Li and Thun Sahacharoen). The scripts provide:

- **Heatmap visualizations** to visualise heatmap of possible impact locations of space debris with Earth.
- **3D model plotting** for projecting the 3D trajectory of the space debris
- **2D model plotting** for projecting the 2D trajectory of the space debris
- **Real data plotting** to visualise real world space debris impact data.
