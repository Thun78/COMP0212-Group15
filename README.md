# COMP0212-Group15

> 📊 A Python visualization and modeling project developed for COMP0212 Group 15.

This repository contains Python scripts for visualizing data and generating analytical models. It includes routines for heatmap plotting, 3D modeling visualization, and plotting real data results.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **COMP0212** course (Group 15). The goal is to demonstrate data visualization and basic modeling techniques using Python. The scripts provide:

- **Heatmap visualizations** for insights into data distributions.
- **3D model plotting** for multi-dimensional analysis.
- **Real data plotting** to visualize experimental or real-world results.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python (version 3.7+ recommended)
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas` (if used in your data loading)
- Any other libraries needed (add here if used, like `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)
