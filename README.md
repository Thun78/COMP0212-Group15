## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **COMP0212 - Modelling and Simulation** (Group 15 - Ted Tang, Muxin Li and Thun Sahacharoen). The scripts provide:

- **Heatmap visualizations** for insights into data distributions.
- **3D model plotting** for multi-dimensional analysis.
- **2D model plotting** for multi-dimensional analysis.
- **Real data plotting** to visualize experimental or real-world results.
